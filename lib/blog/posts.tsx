        <P>
          A friend of mine spent six hours debugging a Stripe Connect
          integration last week.
        </P>
        <P>
          He was using Cursor. He was using Claude 3.5 Sonnet. He was using one
          of the better-documented APIs in the world.
        </P>
        <P>
          For six hours, the model kept inserting a webhook header called{" "}
          <Code>X-Stripe-Connect-Signature</Code> into his verification logic.
          He copied it. He tested it. He read the docs. He read them again. He
          asked the model to &ldquo;double-check the official
          documentation.&rdquo;
        </P>
        <P>The model kept doing it.</P>
        <P>The header does not exist.</P>
        <P>
          Stripe verifies Connect webhooks with <Code>Stripe-Signature</Code> —
          the same header it uses for everything else. The
          &ldquo;Connect&rdquo; version was something the model had quietly
          invented at some point during fine-tuning, and now every agent in his
          stack was confidently reproducing it on demand.
        </P>
        <P>
          He is not a junior engineer. He has shipped six startups. He just
          made the same mistake that almost every team using AI coding
          assistants is making right now: he assumed the documentation was the
          problem.
        </P>
        <P>It wasn&apos;t. It almost never is.</P>

        <H2 id="diagnosis">The diagnosis everyone gets wrong</H2>
        <P>
          Walk into any AI engineering Slack right now and you will hear the
          same conversation on repeat:
        </P>
        <Quote>
          &ldquo;Our agents keep hallucinating our API. We need to improve the
          docs.&rdquo;
        </Quote>
        <P>
          So teams improve the docs. They rewrite endpoints. They add code
          samples. They commission better Markdown. They migrate to fancier
          docs frameworks. They publish a Notion. They publish an OpenAPI. They
          publish an LLMs.txt.
        </P>
        <P>And the hallucinations keep happening.</P>
        <P>Because the diagnosis is wrong.</P>
        <P>
          Hallucinated APIs are not a writing problem. They are not a tone
          problem. They are not even a &ldquo;the docs are incomplete&rdquo;
          problem.
        </P>
        <P>
          They are a <strong>structure</strong> problem. The way documentation
          is shaped on the web is fundamentally hostile to the way models
          actually read.
        </P>

        <H2 id="in-production">What hallucination actually looks like in production</H2>
        <P>
          Open the network tab the next time you use any AI coding assistant
          against a real product&apos;s docs.
        </P>
        <P>You will see one of three things:</P>
        <UL>
          <li>
            The agent crawled the docs root, grabbed the first 12 KB of
            rendered HTML, and called it a day.
          </li>
          <li>
            The agent retrieved three or four chunks from a vector index —
            usually the wrong chunks, because the embedding model has no idea
            your &ldquo;Authentication&rdquo; page is the canonical source for
            header behavior.
          </li>
          <li>
            The agent retrieved nothing at all, because the docs are a
            JavaScript single-page app and the crawler couldn&apos;t see past
            the loading spinner.
          </li>
        </UL>
        <P>
          In every case, the model is being asked to answer a precise,
          schema-level question — <em>&ldquo;what header do I use to verify
          this webhook?&rdquo;</em> — using prose written for humans who are
          expected to read the page top to bottom and understand context from
          layout, sidebar, and tone.
        </P>
        <P>
          The model doesn&apos;t get layout. It doesn&apos;t get sidebar. It
          doesn&apos;t get tone. It gets a flattened bag of paragraphs with
          most of the structural signal stripped out.
        </P>
        <P>
          So it fills in the blanks. It does what language models always do: it
          produces something that <em>sounds</em> like a Stripe header, because
          everything in its training data says headers exist and are named in a
          certain way.
        </P>
        <P>
          That is hallucination. It is not a creativity failure. It is a
          structure failure.
        </P>

        <H2 id="better-docs-doesnt-help">Why &ldquo;better docs&rdquo; doesn&apos;t move the needle</H2>
        <P>
          Imagine you wanted to teach a brand new junior engineer how to call
          your API.
        </P>
        <UL>
          <li>You&apos;d give them the OpenAPI spec.</li>
          <li>You&apos;d give them a Postman collection.</li>
          <li>You&apos;d point them at the SDK source.</li>
          <li>You&apos;d hand them a runnable example.</li>
        </UL>
        <P>
          What you wouldn&apos;t do is tell them: &ldquo;Read these 400 pages
          of Markdown and reason about which one is canonical.&rdquo;
        </P>
        <P>
          That second option is exactly what we are doing with AI agents today.
        </P>
        <P>
          When we say &ldquo;improve the docs,&rdquo; we usually mean: write
          better prose. Add a clearer intro paragraph. Move the warnings up.
          Add another code sample.
        </P>
        <P>
          None of that helps the model. The model already had your prose. It
          generated a header that didn&apos;t exist <em>while</em> it had your
          prose.
        </P>
        <P>
          What the model is missing is{" "}
          <strong>
            structure the agent can index, version, and call with precision
          </strong>
          :
        </P>
        <UL>
          <li>A canonical list of endpoints, not an HTML page of endpoints.</li>
          <li>
            A canonical list of parameter names and their types — not
            paragraphs about them.
          </li>
          <li>
            A canonical list of headers, codes, and constraints — not
            &ldquo;see the section above.&rdquo;
          </li>
          <li>
            A way for the agent to ask{" "}
            <em>&ldquo;what&apos;s the latest version of this endpoint?&rdquo;</em>{" "}
            instead of being trapped in whatever HTML it crawled six minutes
            ago.
          </li>
        </UL>
        <P>
          This is not a writing exercise. It is an infrastructure exercise.
        </P>

        <H2 id="markdown-vs-interface">Markdown was built for humans. Agents need something else.</H2>
        <P>
          The honest version of the problem is this: we built the entire
          documentation web for a reader who is a human with patience, a
          Ctrl-F box, and good judgment.
        </P>
        <P>Agents are none of those things.</P>
        <P>
          An agent is closer to a programmable API consumer than a human
          reader. It needs:
        </P>
        <UL>
          <li>
            <strong>A typed surface.</strong> &ldquo;What endpoints exist? What
            does this one return?&rdquo;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Versioning.</strong> &ldquo;I am working against v2 of your
            API. Don&apos;t show me v1 examples.&rdquo;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tool-shaped retrieval.</strong> &ldquo;When the user asks
            about Connect webhooks, hand me only the canonical
            signature-verification section, not the marketing page.&rdquo;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Live freshness.</strong> &ldquo;These docs changed three
            hours ago. Re-index.&rdquo;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Workflow context.</strong> &ldquo;This call requires that
            call. Don&apos;t suggest one without the other.&rdquo;
          </li>
        </UL>
        <P>
          None of these are properties of a Markdown file. They are properties
          of an <em>interface</em>.
        </P>
        <P>
          Until we stop pretending docs are a flat blob of prose and start
          treating them as an interface that agents call, we will keep getting
          confidently invented headers, deprecated endpoints, and integrations
          that look right in chat and break in production.
        </P>

        <H2 id="mcp-layer">What an AI-native documentation layer looks like</H2>
        <P>
          The shape of the fix is already showing up in production stacks.
        </P>
        <P>
          It is called the <strong>Model Context Protocol</strong> — MCP for
          short. It is a small, simple protocol that lets an AI agent talk to a
          documentation source the way it would talk to any other tool.
        </P>
        <P>The MCP-shaped version of &ldquo;docs&rdquo; looks like this:</P>
        <UL>
          <li>
            <strong>Tools, not pages.</strong> Instead of crawling a 600-URL
            site, the agent calls <Code>search_docs</Code>,{" "}
            <Code>get_endpoint</Code>, <Code>list_versions</Code>,{" "}
            <Code>get_example</Code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Schemas, not screenshots.</strong> Each tool has a typed
            contract. The agent knows what comes back before it asks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Versioning is first-class.</strong> v1, v2, beta —
            explicit, queryable, never mixed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Retrieval is workflow-aware.</strong> Asking{" "}
            <em>&ldquo;how do I verify a Connect webhook&rdquo;</em> returns
            the exact verification section, not a vector-search soup.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Freshness is a property of the protocol.</strong> Docs
            update, MCP server updates, agent sees the change.
          </li>
        </UL>
        <P>
          This is what you actually want sitting between your documentation and
          any AI assistant your team uses.
        </P>
        <P>
          You do not want every agent re-crawling your docs and re-inventing
          your headers. You want a single canonical context layer the agents
          read from.
        </P>
        <P>
          That layer is what we are building at doc2mcp. You point us at a docs
          URL. We generate a production-ready MCP server your agents — Cursor,
          Claude, OpenAI Agents, Windsurf, anything MCP-compatible — can call
          instead of guessing.
        </P>
        <P>But the bigger point is not the product. The bigger point is the category.</P>
        <P>
          <strong>Documentation is becoming infrastructure.</strong> The next
          time you find yourself thinking{" "}
          <em>&ldquo;our docs need to be better for AI,&rdquo;</em> what you
          actually need is not better prose. You need an interface.
        </P>

        <P>
          Every dev I’ve shipped with in the last six months has the same tab
          open at 2&nbsp;AM: a vendor’s docs site, scrolled three pages deep,
          half-copied into a prompt that already lost context. The agent
          hallucinates an endpoint, you fix it, you paste again. It’s a tax we
          stopped questioning.
        </P>
        <P>
          doc2mcp exists because that tax is unnecessary. You don’t need smarter
          prompts — you need a smaller surface area between the docs and the
          model. An MCP server is exactly that surface.
        </P>

        <H2 id="the-problem">The problem isn’t the model. It’s the bridge.</H2>
        <P>
          When an AI agent guesses a route, it’s rarely because the model is
          weak. It’s because the bridge between “what the docs say” and “what
          the model can see at inference time” is held together with copy-paste.
          Three patterns we hear constantly:
        </P>
        <UL>
          <li>
            <strong>Stale context.</strong> The model only knows what was in its
            training set, or what you remembered to paste this morning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lossy summarisation.</strong> 40 pages get crushed into a
            512-token system prompt. Half the auth flow goes missing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Per-tool drift.</strong> Cursor sees one prompt, Claude sees
            another, your CI bot sees a third. Three forks of “the truth”.
          </li>
        </UL>

        <H2 id="what-changes">What changes when you generate an MCP</H2>
        <P>
          An MCP server isn’t a wrapper around your docs — it’s a small,
          structured catalogue of <em>capabilities</em>. Tools, not pages.
          Workflows, not endpoints. The model asks <Code>list_tools()</Code>,
          gets back a typed menu, and picks what it needs.
        </P>
        <Quote>
          You stop teaching the model what your API does. You give it the
          ability to look.
        </Quote>
        <P>That single move kills the three problems above:</P>
        <UL>
          <li>
            The model reads <em>live</em>. No staleness, no re-paste, no “update
            the system prompt” PR.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tools are semantic, not raw. <Code>create_invoice()</Code> instead
            of 7 POST routes with overlapping fields.
          </li>
          <li>
            Every editor — Cursor, Claude Desktop, VS Code, Windsurf — points at
            the same server. One source, many surfaces.

          Be honest about scope. If your “docs” are three half-written README
          paragraphs, generating an MCP won’t conjure structure that isn’t
          there. The score will tell you. Fix the docs first, then convert.

          MCP is the closest thing the AI tooling world has to a real standard.

        <P>
          We mint a per-server bearer token at export time. It’s scoped to that
          MCP and rotatable from your dashboard. The token never appears in a
          URL, never lands in browser history, and never gets logged in
          plaintext on our side. (If your tooling logs request headers, that’s a

          Inside doc2mcp we run a synthetic “first-use” trace against the
          generated server from each editor’s perspective. If a tool would break
          the editor’s schema (e.g. a parameter type it doesn’t accept), the
          export panel surfaces it before you paste anything.

          That’s the whole pitch — write the docs once, generate once, ship
          everywhere.

          The fastest way to leak an MCP token in 2026 is not a fancy attack.
          It’s a screenshot. A streamer Cmd-Shift-4s their editor’s settings
          panel, your bearer token sits there in plain text, and 90 seconds
          later someone is running your API on a free tier. This isn’t

          When you’re shipping AI tooling, the threat model is wider than a

          browser extension on top of your app reads the DOM. Logs land in three

        <P>
          Most "AI breaks in production" stories share a common root cause: the
          docs the model was generated against don't exist anymore. A field got
          renamed. A route got deprecated. An auth scheme moved from{" "}

          Every sync that produces a valid MCP gets a snapshot. Roll back is a

        <P>
          Every team I talk to that's building "an MCP from our API" thinks
          they're done once they have an OpenAPI spec. They are not done.
          They've just finished step one of four.
        </P>
        <P>
          An OpenAPI spec is a great machine-readable inventory. It tells you{" "}
          <em>what exists</em>. It doesn't tell the model{" "}
          <em>when to use what</em>. That gap is where AI agents fall apart.
        </P>

        <H2 id="inventory">Inventory ≠ instructions</H2>
        <P>
          Look at any decent SaaS API. You'll find dozens of routes that
          overlap:
        </P>
        <Pre lang="http">
          {`POST   /users                   create a user
POST   /users/invite            invite a user
POST   /workspaces/:id/members  add to workspace
PUT    /memberships/:id         move between workspaces`}
        </Pre>
        <P>
          A naive MCP exposes all four. The model picks one based on tokenised
          name similarity to your prompt. Half the time it picks wrong, and the
          failure mode is silent — it returns a 200 with the <em>wrong</em> user
          in the wrong workspace.
        </P>

        <H2 id="workflows">Workflows are the unit of usefulness</H2>
        <P>
          The doc2mcp pipeline groups routes into <em>workflows</em>: chains of
          calls that map to one human-intent. The four routes above become one
          tool:
        </P>
        <Pre lang="ts">
          {`onboard_user({ email, role, workspaceId }) {
  // POST /users
  // POST /workspaces/:id/members
  // returns { userId, membershipId }
}`}
        </Pre>
        <P>
          The model now has <em>one</em> obvious choice for "add a teammate to
          our workspace". Failure rate collapses, because there's nothing
          adjacent to pick wrong.
        </P>

        <H2 id="auth">Auth is part of the workflow, not a footnote</H2>
        <P>
          Most OpenAPI specs declare auth at the schema level and forget about
          it. We treat auth as the first step of every workflow. The tool's
          first call is to verify the token's scopes match the operation; if
          they don't, we return a structured error the model knows how to act on
          (refresh, escalate, or stop).
        </P>

        <H2 id="versions">Versions are workflows too</H2>
        <P>
          When v2 of an API ships, the old workflow shouldn't vanish. It should
          be marked <Code>deprecated_in: 2.1.0</Code>, with a machine-readable
          migration block pointing at the new workflow. The MCP serves both for
          a grace period. Your agent fleet migrates gradually instead of
          all-at-once.

          The first agent your team ships will work great in demos and fall over
          silently in production. Not because the model is bad — because you
          can't see what it's doing. Observability for AI agents is different

          There's a version of "AI agent" that involves orchestration diagrams,
          swarm topologies, and a 6-month migration plan. Then there's the
          version that actually ships and makes money. It's smaller than you
