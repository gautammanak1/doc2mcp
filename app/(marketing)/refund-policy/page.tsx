                The Free plan is free forever and does not require any payment —
                there is nothing to refund or cancel. You can stop using the
                service or delete your account at any time.

                  Each paid plan is sold as a one-time Razorpay payment that
                  unlocks a billing window (1 month, 6 months, or 12 months).
                  Plans <strong>do not auto-renew</strong>; when the window
                  ends, your account automatically reverts to the Free plan
                  unless you place a new order.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cancelling, in this context, simply means choosing not to
                  renew. There is no recurring charge to stop.
