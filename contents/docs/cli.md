![doc2mcp CLI](/doc2mcp-cli-banner.png)

## Overview

The **doc2mcp CLI** brings the full conversion pipeline to your terminal. Point it at a
documentation URL and it crawls, analyzes, and serves the docs as a hosted, token-secured
[MCP](/docs/what-is-mcp) server — then installs it straight into Cursor, VS Code, Claude
Desktop, or Windsurf.

It shares the same backend as the [website](https://doc2mcp.site): same pipeline, same plan
limits, same marketplace listing once a project is `ready`. A project you create in the CLI
shows up in your dashboard, and vice‑versa. See the [CLI landing page](/cli) for a visual tour.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g doc2mcp
```

> **Install globally with `-g`.** The `doc2mcp` command is only added to your `PATH` on a global
> install. If you run `npm i doc2mcp` (without `-g`) and get `command not found: doc2mcp`, either
> reinstall with `-g` or run it through your package runner: `npx doc2mcp <docs-url>`.

Works with any package manager (`pnpm add -g`, `yarn global add`, `bun add -g`) and requires
**Node.js 18+**.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Authorize (opens your browser)
doc2mcp login

# 2. Convert docs → hosted MCP
doc2mcp https://docs.stripe.com

# 3. Pick your editor at the install prompt

# 4. Chat with your docs right in the terminal
doc2mcp chat
```

## Command reference

### `doc2mcp <docs-url>`

The default command. Crawls a docs site and generates a hosted MCP server, streaming live
progress (`crawling → analyzing → generating → ready`) until it's done, then offers to install it.

```bash
doc2mcp https://docs.stripe.com
```

- Point at the **docs** URL, not the marketing homepage.
- The URL must start with `http://` or `https://`.
- Counts against your plan's monthly conversion limit (free includes 5/month).

### `doc2mcp login`

Browser-based device authorization — no manual token copying.

```bash
doc2mcp login
```

A short code is displayed, your browser opens to the approval page, and once you approve the CLI
stores a personal access token at `~/.doc2mcp/config.json`.

### `doc2mcp logout`

Removes the stored credentials from this machine.

```bash
doc2mcp logout
```

### `doc2mcp whoami`

Shows the account you're signed in as.

```bash
doc2mcp whoami
```

### `doc2mcp list`

Lists the MCP projects on your account with their status and project IDs.

```bash
doc2mcp list
```

### `doc2mcp install <projectId>`

Installs an MCP you already created into your local editors — without re-running the conversion.
Ideal for setting up a project on a new machine.

```bash
doc2mcp install prj_123abc
```

You choose which detected clients to write to:

| Editor | Config file |
| --- | --- |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` |
| VS Code | user `mcp.json` |
| Claude Desktop | `claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Windsurf | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` |

Existing config is merged, never overwritten.

### `doc2mcp chat [projectId]`

Chat with your docs **without leaving the terminal**. doc2mcp answers natural‑language
questions from the crawled documentation (with cited sources) using the project's hosted MCP —
the same `ask_documentation` tool your editor calls.

```bash
# Interactive: pick a project, then ask away
doc2mcp chat

# Target a specific project
doc2mcp chat prj_123abc

# One-shot question (great for scripts)
doc2mcp chat prj_123abc -m "How do I authenticate requests?"
```

- Run `doc2mcp chat` with no arguments to choose from your `ready` projects.
- Type `/exit` (or press Esc) to leave an interactive session.
- Answers include source page titles and URLs so you can verify them.

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Credentials file | `~/.doc2mcp/config.json` | API URL, token, and user info |
| `DOC2MCP_API_URL` | `https://doc2mcp.site` | Override the API base (local dev / self-hosting) |

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `command not found: doc2mcp` | Installed locally or the shell cached PATH — use `npm i -g doc2mcp`, then run `hash -r` or open a new terminal. `npx doc2mcp <url>` also works |
| Browser won't open on `login` | Copy the printed URL into your browser and approve manually |
| `login` can't reach the server | Check connectivity; for self-hosting set `DOC2MCP_API_URL` |
| "Limit reached" | Monthly conversion limit hit (shared across CLI and web) |
| Editor ignores the new MCP | Fully restart the editor so it reloads MCP config |
| `doc2mcp chat` says no projects | Convert docs first (`doc2mcp <url>`) and wait for `ready` |
